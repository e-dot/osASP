## Welcome to osASP. 

This project is a shy attempt to provide **open source Active Server Pages** to the community and a migration path from Windows to Linux for classic-ASP applications.

Active Server Pages, **ASP** for short, are _Microsoft's server-side scripting technology_, integrated within Internet Information Server (**IIS**) and based on **javascript** (jscript) or **visual basic script** (vbs). So far, Microsoft has always provided backward compatible operating systems for ASP - but this may not be always the case (classic ASP are disabled by default in latest Windows operating systems - this is a clear sign that this technology is obsolete and will not be supported some day).

## Quick Start
    git clone git://github.com/e-dot/osASP
    cd osASP
    node bin/osasp-server.js
